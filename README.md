# dotfiles

Pretty simple; just run the install script. It will move everything to the right location (either into your home directory or /usr/share) and compile everything that needs it.

You will need to install picom, lemonbar and rofi beforehand. the 2bwm sources are a part of this package and are compiled and installed by the script.

My vimrc is pretty basic, I just use it to edit shell and c scripts as well as occasional java. It uses vundle so adding/removing plugins should be a piece of cake.

xinitrc is also pretty basic. By default it uses feh to set a wallpaper from /usr/share/backgrounds/Wallpaper.png.

Install script is stupid simple. Just delete any lines you don't want it doing.

Statusbar is just a script in the 2bwm folder that I run with lemonbar in the xinitrc. You may have to change some of the commands based on your hardware, particularly for the cpu temp. The color commands are specific to lemonbar.

Enjoy the dots!
