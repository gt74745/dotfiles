# dotfiles

Pretty simple, just run the install script. The wm and st builds have all of the correct patches and are pre-compiled (This may change in the future to shrink the repo)
May have to specify which config to use for rofi. 
This uses the ibhagwan-picom fork for compositor. I could probably use a different one since I don't use rounded corners so this may work with others as long as they support kawase blur.
I might make the switch to wayland but I'm not sure whether I can do that with dwm/I don't know how.
My vimrc is pretty basic, I just use it to edit shell and c scripts as well as ocassional java. It uses vundle so adding/removing plugins should be a piece of cake.

Enjoy the dots!
